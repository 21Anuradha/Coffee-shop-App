# Coffee-shop-App
This is a sample Android application that demonstrates how to build a modern, scalable app using the MVVM architecture pattern with Firebase Realtime Database. The app is built using Kotlin and follows best practices for Android development, ensuring code maintainability and testability. The app leverages Firebase for real-time data syncing and utilizes Material Design for an elegant, user-friendly UI.

Features:

MVVM Architecture: Clean separation of concerns with Model-View-ViewModel architecture for better maintainability and testability.

Firebase Realtime Database: Real-time data syncing with Firebase to allow dynamic updates across users.

Material Design: The app utilizes Material Design Components (MDC) to create a visually appealing and consistent UI.

LiveData & ViewModel: Leveraging LiveData to observe data changes in a lifecycle-conscious manner.

Kotlin: The app is developed using Kotlin to take advantage of its modern features and syntax.


Technologies Used:

Kotlin: Main programming language for the application.

MVVM Architecture: View, ViewModel, and Model are separated for better clarity and maintainability.

Firebase Realtime Database: For storing and syncing data across clients in real-time.

Material Design: For building modern and user-friendly interfaces.

LiveData & ViewModel: For managing UI-related data lifecycle-consciously.

Coroutines: For handling background operations and managing asynchronous tasks.
